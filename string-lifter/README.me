# String lifter

This facilitates filing a guitar nut by helping you to lift the strings out
of the slots without having to slacken the strings.

It's inspired by [a tool available from
StewMac](https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/tools-by-job/tools-for-nuts-and-saddles/string-lifter/).

To make the STL file, run `make`.
